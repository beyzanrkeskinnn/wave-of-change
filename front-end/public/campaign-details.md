# Save Our Oceans Initiative

Our oceans are drowning in plastic waste. Every minute, a garbage truck's worth of plastic enters our marine ecosystems, threatening the survival of countless species and the health of our planet. But together, we can turn the tide.

**Join our mission to remove plastic waste from our oceans and protect marine ecosystems.** Every donation helps fund cleanup operations, research, and marine life protection programs.
